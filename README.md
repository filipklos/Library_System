# Library-DB-C++

My project in C++.  
This is my project for the **2nd semester of Computer Science studies** for the subject: **Programming**. The project was created by **two people**.

The project is a **library system** where users and books are managed in a MySQL database. It allows the management of book borrowing and the retrieval of user data from the `users` table in the `library` database.

The program is created to run in **Polish**, and is **multiplatform** â€“ it works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.
